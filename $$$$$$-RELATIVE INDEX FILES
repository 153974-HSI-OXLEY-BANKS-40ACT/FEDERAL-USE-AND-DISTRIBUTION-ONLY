    look at that email between laurie Zucker and Steve Donnell, what did they talk about??? Anything going on in the STFGX ticker prices then in December of 2021. They were trying to snatch another $600,000 from the state while keeping me preoccupied.

        you know more than you need to at this point , I’m not looking at the order again, plus, I forgot how to multiply as well.

        I provided my wire instructions separately to Miss Chatman and Mr. Kilkenny at JPM ( where they transferred my Security ) I also copied the representatives at JP Morgan as well, thank you!

        Moved a little quickly there didn’t you, but that was August 10TH of 2020. Check the date of execution CF00031.

        On August 10th 2020. My apartment was 150 SQFT.. you telling me it’s 400$ a foot +37 *150 = 5550, sorry. That’s $65,550.00 not the 60,000.00 below.

        You selling them for $60,000?

        Then, it would be `3.7MM as valued and paid for in your prior 5 years of taxes, as reported to State Farm realty or whoever it is you needed to borrow $6 million from…

        You could have just asked nicely to inspect my apartment you know… but now it’s two years later right? And five years of tax evasion later. That’s what happens when you unreasonably harass me, I will work extra hard to find you, no edgars right??? Ricki? You attached to a Edgar, come over here let me go talk to them. Ah? Got em covered right? All of them?? For what though?

        I’ll get back to you — and will absolutely use the two dollar lawyers recommendation letter as well, the one from the 10th of August in 2020.

    I don’t care, I just know it’s corruption and at the expense of my unlawful restraint, you understand what that is?

    look at that email between laurie Zucker and Steve Donnell, what did they talk about??? Anything going on in the STFGX ticker prices then in December of 2021. They were trying to snatch another $600,000 from the state while keeping me preoccupied.

        - make sure that Miss Hochul takes care of whatever the rent was I am owed in arrears, I forgot the order number, 2395 * 13 months. You know I’m not wasting another moment dealing with that nonsense, for REASONABLE CAUSE, so hopefully this is sufficient for notice.
        —- all of it, immediately. 

        you know more than you need to at this point , I’m not looking at the order again, plus, I forgot how to multiply as well.
             
        I provided my wire instructions separately to Miss Chatman and Mr. Kilkenny at JPM ( where they transferred my Security ) I also copied the representatives at JP Morgan as well, thank you!

        Moved a little quickly there didn’t you, but that was August 10TH of 2020. Check the date of execution CF00031. 

        On August 10th 2020. My apartment was 150 SQFT.. you telling me it’s 400$ a foot +37 *150 = 5550, sorry. That’s $65,550.00 not the 60,000.00 below. 
             
        You selling them for $60,000? 

        Then, it would be `3.7MM as valued and paid for in your prior 5 years of taxes, as reported to State Farm realty or whoever it is you needed to borrow $6 million from… 
               
        You could have just asked nicely to inspect my apartment you know… but now it’s two years later right? And five years of tax evasion later. That’s what happens when you unreasonably harass me, I will work extra hard to find you, no edgars right??? Ricki? You attached to a Edgar, come over here let me go talk to them. Ah? Got em covered right? All of them?? For what though?

        I’ll get back to you — and will absolutely use the two dollar lawyers recommendation letter as well, the one from the 10th of August in 2020.

    And an attempt to defraud again, while dealing in 153974/2020 as referenced below to obtain some $600,000 discount or something.. 

    I don’t care, I just know it’s corruption and at the expense of my unlawful restraint, you understand what that is?

    look at that email between laurie Zucker and Steve Donnell, what did they talk about??? Anything going on in the STFGX ticker prices then in December of 2021. They were trying to snatch another $600,000 from the state while keeping me preoccupied.

        This information also, is crazy felonious, definitely you can to Prison for that, look that email between laurie Zucker and Steve Donnell, what did they talk about?

        Moved a little quickly there didn’t you, but that was August 10TH of 2020. Check the date of execution CF00031. 

        On August 10th 2020. My apartment was 150 SQFT.. you telling me it’s 400$ a foot +37 *150 = 5550, sorry. That’s $65,550.00 not the 60,000.00 below. 
             
        You selling them for $60,000? 

        Then, it would be `3.7MM as valued and paid for in your prior 5 years of taxes, as reported to State Farm realty or whoever it is you needed to borrow $6 million from… 
               
        You could have just asked nicely to inspect my apartment you know… but now it’s two years later right? And five years of tax evasion later. That’s what happens when you unreasonably harass me, I will work extra hard to find you, no edgars right??? Ricki? You attached to a Edgar, come over here let me go talk to them. Ah? Got em covered right? All of them?? For what though?

        I’ll get back to you — and will absolutely use the two dollar lawyers recommendation letter as well, the one from the 10th of August in 2020.

    Another felony, another NYSCEF 251334/2021

    And an attempt to defraud again, while dealing in 153974/2020 as referenced below to obtain some $600,000 discount or something.. 

    I don’t care, I just know it’s corruption and at the expense of my unlawful restraint, you understand what that is?

    look at that email between laurie Zucker and Steve Donnell, what did they talk about??? Anything going on in the STFGX ticker prices then in December of 2021. They were trying to snatch another $600,000 from the state while keeping me preoccupied.

        - make sure that Miss Hochul takes care of whatever the rent was I am owed in arrears, I forgot the order number, 2395 * 13 months. You know I’m not wasting another moment dealing with that nonsense, for REASONABLE CAUSE, so hopefully this is sufficient for notice.
        —- all of it, immediately. 

        you know more than you need to at this point , I’m not looking at the order again, plus, I forgot how to multiply as well.
             
        I provided my wire instructions separately to Miss Chatman and Mr. Kilkenny at JPM ( where they transferred my Security ) I also copied the representatives at JP Morgan as well, thank you!

        Moved a little quickly there didn’t you, but that was August 10TH of 2020. Check the date of execution CF00031. 

        On August 10th 2020. My apartment was 150 SQFT.. you telling me it’s 400$ a foot +37 *150 = 5550, sorry. That’s $65,550.00 not the 60,000.00 below. 
             
        You selling them for $60,000? 

        Then, it would be `3.7MM as valued and paid for in your prior 5 years of taxes, as reported to State Farm realty or whoever it is you needed to borrow $6 million from… 
               
        You could have just asked nicely to inspect my apartment you know… but now it’s two years later right? And five years of tax evasion later. That’s what happens when you unreasonably harass me, I will work extra hard to find you, no edgars right??? Ricki? You attached to a Edgar, come over here let me go talk to them. Ah? Got em covered right? All of them?? For what though?

        I’ll get back to you — and will absolutely use the two dollar lawyers recommendation letter as well, the one from the 10th of August in 2020.
