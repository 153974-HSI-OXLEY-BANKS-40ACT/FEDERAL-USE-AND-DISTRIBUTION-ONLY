Gov. Hochul,

*** THIS WILL WORK ***

-- I took the Wilson and Dicker firm off the email thread. and only left the Zuckers and counselors of Columbia that they spoke with during the proceedings in NYSCEF 153974/2020.

https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/law/downloads/pdf/Real%20Property%20Tax%20Audit%20Report%20Form%20(4-2013).pdf

They don't need to share their results with me... their interests are all safe with you Gov. Hochul, and your third party review team (which should be two audit firms that are NOT affiliated) with any of these affairs


- try standard chartered and maybe another one, and then have them cross-reference with your Comptroller (who i met earlier by the way, not the new one though) the old guy at Bobby Vans.

I have no say in the TIME LIMIT to INDEPENDENTLY QUALIFY this as a proper way to identify variations observed in their assessments of VALUE in those property taxes for the 144 units and 6 respective buildings - filed and reported with the DFS to obtain a $6 million dollar loan from state farm... but

I think ONE FORM for each unit is the best way AND NOT TO BE SADISTIC, HONESTLY

- but that way it's easier to analyze variations by unit and by each person.
- Especially since they already failed to even bring light to the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to have them qualified as "LAWFUL RENTAL PROPERTIES"  without a certificate of occupancy

--- if you don't do it that way... it will be difficult to find the criminals among the group of participants that circulated those un-consented videos of myself...
--- If you want to figure it out, those 144 reports will prove who/who did not participate in the violation of my privacy.

If you do it one unit per form, they file 144 forms and unlawfully represent those interests 144 times...  they cannot argue any further that they made a fat finger mistake

- it will be very easy to understand who did and didn't understand what is going on, and who was and wasn't responsible for being an accessory to tax evasion as represented in the dockets in NYSCEF 153974/2020.

FOR A 24 hour WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY - just like that STFGX move on Dec 22, 2021 --- If the onus was on me I would get it done like now.

--- all I care about is the 144 units, and they should INDEPENDENTLY fill out the form to see if they are all in sync.  or if there a variation in the majority opinion...

plus, it's only 17 pages... per unit.

I understand... paperwork can be annoying sometimes, but if these Wilson & Elser lawyers and the others that represented the interests of the Sullivan Properties LP as directors take the time to each assess those properties, it will take much less time to figure out who is guilty and put a stop to any furtherance of these continuing crimes.


How long can it take for all of them to complete this in light of the damages registered and gross negligence of the carried interest over a period of 10 years that I know about. (5) This is required by police officers for each traffic violation or even for an expired registration, they can't just group up chevrolet violations as one ticket - its each license plate - so I mean it's only fair that they report it for each unit --- in case they make 144 mistakes in a row - you'll know they are guilty.

Without a CO they can't be qualified as buildings with X number of units as "rental units" that generate income... So for the 144 units, each having an address--- do you think their numbers will all match up - or differ based on opinion?

I just used the base cap rate, using the table of all owners to make my assessment

- the one I posted them with earlier...

#GOCARDS.

/s/ BO DINCER.

Hey if you want to get serious and have a REAL opinion... get serious and wake the heck up-- it's problem, not yours. - but give them a time limit on when to submit those forms, that's more money than they can all make COMBINED in a year in tax-evasion, it was up in the $500 million range in 2020, so...

as the fed-30 RATE MOVES HIGHER, THEY ACTUALLY GET TAXED MORE ON THE COMPOUND DAILY INTEREST FOR THE TWO YEARS OF AVOIDANCE AND IBSTRUCTION IN THE PRIOR...

---- plus they're going to have way more issues by the time I am done watching this movie here instead

i left one confidant, in the BCC from Columbia, only because he will respect me for this method, if he has an objection, or a suggestion he will contact you directly.

thank you.
