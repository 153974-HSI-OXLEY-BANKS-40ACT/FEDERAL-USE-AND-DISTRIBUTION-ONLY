See what happens is, when your phone turns on and sends something, it goes to a tower.

So when your not in times square, its easier to figure out which towers are available, and log the numbers thatvused them .

 For example.

So put these in a spreadsheet and send them to the FBI.
-- Use codeword Ferreira, metropolitan tower loan 50074 and include the emails in the CC. 

Copy this in there so::
I don't play man, moustache or not...
-- stay the fuck away from me when im trying to knock this fortress of a zucker and their accessories and stop acting like a bitch.  also, keep your fucking mouth shut before i break the front portion of your face into chicken bones and stay the fuck out of my proximity.... all of you.
   
Thank you for your assistance gentleman.
--  that beer, was a good choice.. always welcome.
