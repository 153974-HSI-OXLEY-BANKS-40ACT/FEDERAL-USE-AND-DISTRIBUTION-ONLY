SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW WHERE 
STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I PUT THE CLAUSE 
FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT PROVISION WAS SO THAT 
STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE 
ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES 
ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN 
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL*- THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.*

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Xjn0/e1NcBADqRc_PLUS_g11P4g==

- AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME AT 
LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?

- THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET THEM 
STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00 IN TAX 
DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..


-- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.

#GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN THE 
90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.

- I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.


ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.

- KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL VERSED

UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.

 > THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM 
IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.

*GOOD LUCK, TWO YEARS LIKE NOTHING IS GOING ON, AND WHILE THEY CANVAS 
NEW OPPORTUNITIES IS "MADNESS"*

*- UNLESS YOU FEEL DIFFERENT ABOUT THEIR EXPERTISE, ADVISORY, AND 
ETHICAL PROCEDURES - BELONG IN ONE PLACE.*

- THE BACK TAXES ON THE SIX PROPERTIES OF INTEREST TRANSFERRED TO STATE FARM

IN FACT PRESENTS A GREATER ACTUAL DOLLAR VALUE (IN US DOLLARS) THAN THE 
ENTIRE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF SFITX - A "FRONT-END" TREASURY BOND FUND 
THAT REPRESENTS A 3-YEAR KEY RATE MATURITY.

SEE ALSO, 30-DAY LIBOR IN THE FORMER, OR FED-FUNDS-30, FED-FUNDS-60, 
FED-FUNDS-90
- THE SHORT-TERM FEDERAL RATES, TO MY UNDERSTANDING.


FRIDAY PRICE DAY-ON-DAY, I HAVE SEEN IT AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES BUT NOT 
IN THE SAME YEAR AND BY THEIR OTHER MUNICIPAL BOND FUND.
