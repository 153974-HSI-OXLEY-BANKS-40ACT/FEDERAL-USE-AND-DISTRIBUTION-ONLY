# USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest
(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official 
responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and 
circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request 
for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written 
determination made by such official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;

(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees 
covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the 
financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection 
(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity 
of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such 
regulation applies;

(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

        # USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest<br>
        (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being
        an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United
        States Government, or of any independent agency of the United
        States, a Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee,
        or an officer or employee of the District of Columbia, including
        a special Government employee, participates personally and
        substantially as a Government officer or employee, through
        decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering
        of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other
        proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other
        determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation,
        arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge,
        he, his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in
        which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, general
        partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he
        is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
        employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to the
        penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.<br>
        (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-<br>
        (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government
        official responsible for appointment to his or her position of
        the nature and circumstances of the judicial or other
        proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other
        determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation,
        arrest, or other particular matter and makes full disclosure of
        the financial interest and receives in advance a written
        determination made by such official that the interest is not so
        substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of
        the services which the Government may expect from such officer
        or employee;<br>
        (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of
        Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all
        officers and employees covered by this section, and published in
        the Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted
        from the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or
        too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of
        the Government officers or employees to which such regulation
        applies;<br>
        (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
        advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
        Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
        appointment to such a position), the official responsible for
        the employee's appointment, after review of the financial
        disclosure report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics
        in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need
        for the individual's services outweighs the potential for a
        conflict of interest created by the financial interest
        involved...<br>
