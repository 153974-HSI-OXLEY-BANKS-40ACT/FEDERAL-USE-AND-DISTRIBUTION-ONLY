  USC 18. ยง208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest

(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-

|-Shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this 
title. *(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-* *(1) if the officer or 
employee first advises the Government official responsible for 
appointment to his or her position of the nature and circumstances of 
the judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or 
other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, 
arrest, or other particular matter and makes full disclosure of the 
financial interest and receives in advance a written determination made 
by such official that the interest is not so substantial as to be deemed 
likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may 
expect from such officer or employee;* (2) if, by regulation issued by 
the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, applicable to all or a 
portion of all officers and employees covered by this section, and 
published in the Federal Register, the financial interest has been 
exempted from the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or 
too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the 
Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies; (3) 
in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved; or 
*(4) if the financial interest that would be affected by the particular 
matter involved is that resulting solely from the interest of the 
officer or employee, or his or her spouse or minor child, in 
birthrights-* (A) in an Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized 
group or community, including any Alaska Native village corporation as 
defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs 
and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their 
status as Indians, (B) in an Indian allotment the title to which is held 
in trust by the United States or which is inalienable by the allottee 
without the consent of the United States, or (C) in an Indian claims 
fund held in trust or administered by the United States, -if the 
particular matter does not involve the Indian allotment or claims fund 
or the Indian tribe, band, nation, organized group or community, or 
Alaska Native village corporation as a specific party or parties. (c)(1) 
For the purpose of paragraph (1) of subsection (b), in the case of class 
A and B directors of Federal Reserve banks, the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System shall be deemed to be the Government official 
responsible for appointment. (2) The potential availability of an 
exemption under any particular paragraph of subsection (b) does not 
preclude an exemption being granted pursuant to another paragraph of 
subsection (b). (d)(1) Upon request, a copy of any determination 
granting an exemption under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made 
available to the public by the agency granting the exemption pursuant to 
the procedures set forth in section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act 
of 1978. In making such determination available, the agency may withhold 
from disclosure any information contained in the determination that 
would be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5. For 
purposes of determinations under subsection (b)(3), the information 
describing each financial interest shall be no more extensive than that 
required of the individual in his or her financial disclosure report 
under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. (2) The Office of Government 
Ethics, after consultation with the Attorney General, shall issue 
uniform regulations for the issuance of waivers and exemptions under 
subsection (b) which shall- (A) list and describe exemptions; and (B) 
provide guidance with respect to the types of interests that are not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services the Government may expect from the employee.|
