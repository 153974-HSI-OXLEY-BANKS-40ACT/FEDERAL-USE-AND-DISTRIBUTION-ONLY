WHAT HAPPENS TO STATE FARM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY -

NOT A BANK?

STATE FARM SELF CUSTODIES, ADMINISTERS, AND DOESN'T REPORT THEIR HOLDINGS.


WHICH IS ALSO WHY, THESE ARE THE BIGGEST - RISKIEST WALKING DISASTERS I 
HAVE EVER SEEN.

- BUT HEY, IF THEY CAN''T FIND THE LOAN, TRUST ME - THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT 
IT'S WORTH EITHER RIGHT?

-- DO THOSE OPLICY HOLDERS KNOW ABOUT 50074?
