      *Days Inn
      Terms of Use of Internet*

      TERMS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES


        *AGREEMENT BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND Active Telephones, LLC*

The Service consists of providing a wireless or high speed internet 
connection to authorized users. This Service is offered to you, the 
customer, conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the 
terms, conditions, and notices contained herein.
Your use of this Service constitutes your agreement to all such terms, 
conditions, and notices.


        *SECURITY OF YOUR ACCESS AND USE*

Due to the nature of wireless LAN and High Speed Internet Access, 
control of physical access to the network cannot be ensured. In the case 
of wireless networks, unlike a wired network where a physical connection 
is required, anyone within range of a wireless access point can 
conceivably send and receive frames as well as listen for other frames 
being sent, making eavesdropping and remote sniffing of wireless LAN 
frames very easy. In addition, under certain circumstances, third 
parties could access your computer without your permission while it is 
connected to the network.


        *PERSONAL AND NONCOMMERCIAL USE LIMITATION*

This Service is for your personal, noncommercial use. You may not 
modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, 
publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any

Telephones, LLC MAKES NO COMMITMENT TO UPDATE THE MATERIALS, MAINTAIN 
THE SERVICE, OR ITS QUALITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL Active Telephones, LLC 
AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,

LOSS OF PROFITS OR DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF Active 
Telephones, LLC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION 
MAY PRESENTLY NOT APPLY TO YOU.


        *NO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE*

As a condition of your use of the Service, you warrant to Active 
Telephones, LLC that you will not use this Service for any purpose that 
is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices.

America, exclusive of the choice of law rules thereof. This Agreement

subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral and written 
agreements. No failure or delay on the part of Active Telephones, LLC in
