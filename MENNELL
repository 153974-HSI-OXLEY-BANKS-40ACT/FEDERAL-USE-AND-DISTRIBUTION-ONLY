    attn: Miss Jasmine Moore,

    My selective service papers are attached here as requested.

    Are you certain that all of the information on my application was reviewed - because it show that it was all submitted and the cause for NOT hiring me is bizarre.

    - IT SAYS AT LEAST ONE YEAR OF GRADUATE SCHOOL EXPERIENCE AS CAUSE FOR NOT HIRING ME.

    I FILED MY APPLICATION TO THE HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL AND I WAS ACCEPTED.
        I APPLIED to the HKS and offered them $1.10 AS MY FINANCIAL contribution and ability to pay.
        I WAS ACCEPTED, not BECAUSE I BOUGHT MY WAY IN TO THEIR HIGH BARRIER OF ENTRY, I HAVE BEEN ENROLLED SINCE 2011.

    Most Respectfully,
    Bo Dincer.
    - I haven't contact Columbia University and their registrar for very Obvious Reasons, so please reconsider those statements as referenced in the outcome below and let me know if it's still an issue.
    - Also, if anyone called you - provided you other information, or false information...
    I would like to know about that as well, namely because you never returned my call.




    MY GPA is a 4.0,
    AND ANYTHING AT HARVARD GREATER THAN 75% IS CONSIDERED AN A
