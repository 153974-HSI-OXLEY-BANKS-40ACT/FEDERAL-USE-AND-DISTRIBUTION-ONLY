 CONFIRMED.
 -- UNLAWFUL RENTS "FRIVOLOUS INCOME" IS REPORTED IN ALL SIX BUILDINGS USED AS A GUARANTEE TO STATE FARM TO OBTAIN A LOAN FOR $6,000,000.00
 -- 18.215, 18.2 - STATE FARM DIRECTORS FILED THEIR BONUS PAYMENTS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR A "SUCCESSFUL MERGER"
 ------ IN FACT, WERE TRYING TO KEEP AL THE "DIRTY" FILES IN CIK FILER 93715, WHICH IS MOST LIKELY WHY MR. DAVID MOORE DID NOT USE THE CORRECT SEC FILER NUMBER IN HIS PETITION.
 ------ ALREADY DISTRIBUTED TO ALL RELEVANT PARTIES EARLIER, MAYBE THEY DIDN'T CATCH THAT EITHER.
