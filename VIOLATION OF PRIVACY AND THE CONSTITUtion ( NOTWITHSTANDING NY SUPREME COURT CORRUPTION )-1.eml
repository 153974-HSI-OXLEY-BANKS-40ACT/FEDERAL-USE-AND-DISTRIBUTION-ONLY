> UNDERWRITERS -UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS SEC. 17. (a) It shall be unlawful

> for a registered investment company (other than a company of the 
> character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), or any 
> affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal

> solely (A) securities of which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities 
> of which the seller is the issuer and which are part of a general 
> offering to the holders of a class of its securities, or (C) 
> securities deposited with the trustee of a unit investment trust or 
> periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof; (2) knowingly to 
> purchase from such registered company, or from any company controlled 
> by such registered company, any security or other property (except 
> securities of which the seller is the issuer) Liability of directors, 
> etc., for willful misfeasance. SEC. 17. (h) After one year from the 
> effective date of this title, neither the charter, certificate of 
> incorporation, articles of association, indenture of trust, nor the 
> by-laws of any registered investment company, nor any other instrument 
> pursuant to which such a company is organized or administered, shall 
> contain any provision which protects or purports to protect any 
> director or officer of such company against any liability to the 
> company or to its security holders to which he would otherwise be 
> subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence 
> or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his 
> office. In the event that any such instrument does not at the 
> effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this 
> subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the 
> expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to 
> be a registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate 
> this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such director or 
> officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of 
> any protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it does 
> not comply with this subsection, and each such person subsequently 
> elected or appointed shall before assuming office file a similar 
> waiver. (i) After one year from the effective date of this title no 
> contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as 
> investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered 
> investment company shall contain any provision which protects or 
> purports to protect such person against any liability to such company 
> or its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by 
> reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the 
> performance of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of 
> his obligations and duties under such contract or agreement. 
> Injunctions against gross abuse. SEC. 36. The Commission is authorized 
> to bring an action in the proper district court of the United States 
> or United States court of any Territory or other place subject to the 
> jurisdiction of the United States, alleging that a person serving or 
> acting in one or more of the following capacities has been guilty, 
> after the enactment of this title and within five years of the 
> commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of 
> trust in respect of any registered investment company for which such 
> person so serves or acts: (1) as officer, director, member of an 
> advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor; or (2) as principal 
> underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end company, unit 
> investment trust, or face-amount certificate company. If the 
> Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse of 
> trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
> in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period 
> of time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate. SEC. 32. (c) 
> The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in the 
> public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
> accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
> documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
> such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make 
> the same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
> representative thereof. DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND 
> RECORDS SEC. 34. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as 
> permitted by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully 
> to destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document 
> the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a)

> statement of a material fact in any registration statement, 
> application, report, account, record, or other document filed or 
> transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is required 
> pursuant to section 31 (a). It shall be unlawful for any person so

> therein any fact necessary in order to prevent the statements made 
> therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, 
> from being materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, 
> any part of any such document which is signed or certified by an 
> accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to be 
> made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or auditor, as

        Farm VP Management Corp.? - Attached are communications between
        3/31/2021 and as of current - for avoidance to an accuracy
        related penalty as attested by the Directors of the former CIK
        93715 ( which has ceased to exist ) - in their current filer as
        the same CRD MEMBERS under the auspice of FINRA in filer CIK
        1516523 have under CERT 63.18 failed to disclose any "legal
        proceeding", or "claims" after having participated in the letter
        of credit annexed in NYSCEF matter 153974/2020 - and that there
        is "NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT" Hence, it is important to
        keep those Directors in check, and more specifically the 9
        executive links AFTER they don't update anything. - The TIPS I
        filed earlier as well, for convenience are held "somewhere" in
        the 311-REPOSITORY, no address required there either as forward
        guidance. FILED, however was a complaint FOR 111 REAR SULLIVAN
        STREET, where I filed a " NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY COMPLAINT
        " as a document uploaded the prior filed NO CERTIFICATE OF
        OCCUPANCY that I annexed in the matter and on the 4th of August
        in 2020 - I am certain the supervisor then and now have had an
        issue with the internet, as they were "unable to gain access to
        the building" to check on the "unlawful use of property" and "NO
        CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY" complaint I filed with the Department
        of Buildings then, continues to report "unlawful" gross income
        to the NYC Finance Register for them to evaluate and
        automatically propagate a "MARKET VALUE" using the "base cap
        rate" - which is the "ordinary rate an investor would expect on
        real property" ---- as promulgated therein the receipts and by
        NYC Department of Finance in the Public Record, were more likely
        than not also issued to their investors and used to obtain a
        letter of credit as well, from State Farm in May of 2020,
        annexed in the matter as referenced hereunder. CAPACITY... Thank
        you for reviewing the attached emails and for convenience, I

        Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to
        sanction any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was
        associated with an investment adviser, if the Commission finds
        that the sanction is in the public interest and the person has
        been convicted of any offense specified in Section 203(e)(2)
        within ten years of the commencement of proceedings. 15 U.S.C. §

        between January 2008 and October 2008 and with committing wire
        fraud. 15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
        (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
        faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc. Any person who
        shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application,
        report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any rule
        or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a
        registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
        78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
        light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
        misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
        any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
        misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
        purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by
        such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the
        person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no
        knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person
        seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in
        any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court
        may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment
        of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs,
        including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party
        litigant. (b)Contribution Every person who becomes liable to
        make payment under this section may recover contribution as in
        cases of contract from any person who, if joined in the original
        suit, would have been liable to make the same payment. (c)Period
        of limitations No action shall be maintained to enforce any
        liability created under this section unless brought within one
        year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of
        action and within three years after such cause of action
        accrued. [SFITX] 15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration,
        responsibilities, and oversight of self-regulatory organizations
        (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of
        the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule
        filed by a registered securities association that primarily
        concerns conduct related to transactions in government
        securities, except where the Commission determines that an
        emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and
        publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury
        comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that
        has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in
        writing to such written comment before approving the proposed
        rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies
        the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, would, or as
        applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of
        the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden
        on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of
        the purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to
        adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary and
        appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section
        notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.
        <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljdec/2015/id739ce.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljdec/2015/id739ce.pdf</a> [t]he proper
        functioning of the securities industry and markets depends on
        the integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
        transparent disclosure. Securities industry participation by
        persons with a history of fraudulent conduct is antithetical to
        the protection of investors. . . . We have long held that a
        history of egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness
        for future participation in the securities industry even if the
        disqualifying conduct is not related to the professional
        capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she
        engaged in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The
        industry relies on the fairness and integrity of all persons
        associated with each of the professions covered by the
        collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other
        market participants. TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS
        AND UNDERWRITERS -UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS SEC. 17. (a) It shall be
        unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or principal
        underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a
        company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and
        (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or
        principal underwriter, acting as principal- (1) knowingly to
        sell any security or other property to such registered company
        or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company,
        unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the
        buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the
        issuer and which are part of a general offering to the holders
        of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited with
        the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment plan
        by the depositor thereof; (2) knowingly to purchase from such
        registered company, or from any company controlled by such
        registered company, any security or other property (except
        securities of which the seller is the issuer) Liability of
        directors, etc., for willful misfeasance. SEC. 17. (h) After one
        year from the effective date of this title, neither the charter,
        certificate of incorporation, articles of association, indenture
        of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment company,
        nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is
        organized or administered, shall contain any provision which
        protects or purports to protect any director or officer of such
        company against any liability to the company or to its security
        holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of
        willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
        disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.
        In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective
        date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection
        (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the
        expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless
        continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be
        deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration
        date each such director or officer shall have filed with the
        Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of
        the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this
        subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or
        appointed shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.
        (i) After one year from the effective date of this title no
        contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act
        as investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a
        registered investment company shall contain any provision which
        protects or purports to protect such person against any
        liability to such company or its security holders to which he
        would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
        faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or
        by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and
        duties under such contract or agreement. Injunctions against
        gross abuse. SEC. 36. The Commission is authorized to bring an
        action in the proper district court of the United States or
        United States court of any Territory or other place subject to
        the jurisdiction of the United States, alleging that a person
        serving or acting in one or more of the following capacities has
        been guilty, after the enactment of this title and within five
        years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or
        gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment
        company for which such person so serves or acts: (1) as officer,
        director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or
        depositor; or (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered
        company is an open-end company, unit investment trust, or
        face-amount certificate company. If the Commission's allegations
        of such gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust are
        established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting in
        such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such
        period of time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.
        SEC. 32. (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and
        regulations or order in the public interest or for the
        protection of investors, to require accountants and auditors to
        keep reports, work sheets, and other documents and papers
        relating to registered investment companies for such period or
        periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the same
        available for inspection by the Commission or any member or
        representative thereof. DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS
        AND RECORDS SEC. 34. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person,
        except as permitted by rule, regulation, or order of the
        Commission, willfully to destroy, mutilate, or alter any
        account, book, or other document the preservation of which has
        been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 (c). (b) It shall
        be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a
        material fact in any registration statement, application,
        report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted
        pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is required
        pursuant to section 31 (a). It shall be unlawful for any person
        so filing, transmitting, or keeping any such document to omit to
        state therein any fact necessary in order to prevent the
        statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
        which they were made, from being materially misleading. For the
        purposes of this subsection, any part of any such document which
        is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his
        capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted,
        or kept by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person
        filing, transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

        _Attached are supplements for convenience._<br>
        DRP not required by the Directors of State Farm VP Management
        Corp.?<br>
        - Attached are communications between 3/31/2021 and as of
        current - for avoidance to an accuracy related penalty as
        attested by the Directors of the former CIK 93715 ( which has
        ceased to exist ) - in their current filer as the same CRD
        MEMBERS under the auspice of FINRA in filer CIK 1516523 have
        under CERT 63.18 failed to disclose any "legal proceeding", or
        "claims" after having participated in the letter of credit
        annexed in NYSCEF matter 153974/2020 - and that there is
        "NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT"<br>
        <br>
        Hence, it is important to keep those Directors in check, and
        more specifically the 9 executive links AFTER they don't update
        anything.<br>
        <br>
        - The TIPS I filed earlier as well, for convenience are held
        "somewhere" in the 311-REPOSITORY, no address required there
        either as forward guidance.<br>
        FILED, however was a complaint FOR 111 REAR SULLIVAN STREET,
        where I filed a " NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY COMPLAINT " as a
        document uploaded the prior filed NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
        that I annexed in the matter and on the 4th of August in 2020<br>
        <br>
        - I am certain the supervisor then and now have had an issue
        with the internet, as they were "unable to gain access to the
        building" to check on the "unlawful use of property" and "NO
        CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY" complaint I filed with the Department
        of Buildings then, continues to report "unlawful" gross income
        to the NYC Finance Register for them to evaluate and
        automatically propagate a "MARKET VALUE" using the "base cap
        rate" - which is the "ordinary rate an investor would expect on
        real property"<br>
        ---- as promulgated therein the receipts and by NYC Department
        of Finance in the Public Record, were more likely than not also
        issued to their investors and used to obtain a letter of credit
        as well, from State Farm in May of 2020, annexed in the matter
        as referenced hereunder.<br>

        Thank you for reviewing the attached emails and for convenience,

        experts THENCE, FIRST on measurement.<br>
