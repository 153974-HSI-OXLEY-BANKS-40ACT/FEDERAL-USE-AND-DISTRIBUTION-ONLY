GTG I HOPE YOU SORT THAT OUT, SERIOUSLY CONCERNED.
- THE BACK TAXES ON THE SIX PROPERTIES OF INTEREST TRANSFERRED TO STATE FARM

IN FACT PRESENTS A GREATER ACTUAL DOLLAR VALUE (IN US DOLLARS) THAN THE ENTIRE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF SFITX - A "FRONT-END" TREASURY BOND FUND THAT REPRESENTS A 3-YEAR KEY RATE MATURITY.
   
SEE ALSO, 30-DAY LIBOR IN THE FORMER, OR FED-FUNDS-30, FED-FUNDS-60, FED-FUNDS-90
- THE SHORT-TERM FEDERAL RATES, TO MY UNDERSTANDING.


FRIDAY PRICE DAY-ON-DAY, I HAVE SEEN IT AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES BUT NOT IN THE SAME YEAR AND BY THEIR OTHER MUNICIPAL BOND FUND.

   

THEY ALSO SELF DECLARE THE VALUE OF THEIR TREASURY BOND SECURITIES, IN CASE YOU WERE WAAAANDERING.
