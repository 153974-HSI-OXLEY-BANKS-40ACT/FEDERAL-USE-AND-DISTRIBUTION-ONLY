Listen, i'm not sure who is telling you what to do over there - but 
honestly - if you do anything stupid/illegal they will turn you upside 
down and do what you understand is unlawful ok. It's all good, but I 
just want to make sure you understand - if you start deleting things.. 
they will figure that out and it is worse.

- it's better to just keep it clean, doesn't matter what on there if you 
did something wrong you're going to own upto it.

- don't put yourself or anything on the line for what beyond those gates.

love yall.
