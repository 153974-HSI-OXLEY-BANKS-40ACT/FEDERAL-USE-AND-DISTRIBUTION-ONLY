26 U.S. Code § 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on 
underpayments

§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
(a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on 
any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) and 
§ 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is 
attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:

(1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see § 1.6662-3);

(2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see § 1.6662-4); or

(3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 
(“substantial valuation misstatement” or “gross valuation 
misstatement”), provided the applicable dollar limitation set forth in 
section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see § 1.6662-5).


(b) Amount of penalty -

(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent 
of the portion of an underpayment
of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of 
the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.

(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 
6662(h)(2) and § 1.6662-5(e)(2),
the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion 
of an underpayment of tax required
to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation 
misstatement, provided the applicable
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.



§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapter 1.
(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section 
6664(a) and
§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A of 
the Code that is
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
valuation misstatement
under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement”), there is added 
to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
(“gross valuation misstatement”).
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of 
an underpayment
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
unless the aggregate
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross 
valuation misstatements
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
(b) and
(f)(2) of this section.
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause 
and good faith exception to this penalty
set forth in § 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to 
this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unless

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
defined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.



(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

I ANNEXED THESE - JUST IN CASE.

HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME = $0.00

(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

          In the event that any such instrument does not at the 
effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this 
subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the 
expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to 
be a registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate 
this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such director or 
officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any 
protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not 
comply with this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected 
or appointed shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

          <br>
          26 U.S. Code § 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty
          on underpayments<br>
          <br>
          § 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.<br>
          (a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related
          penalty on any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined
          in section 6664(a) and § 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a
          return if such portion is attributable to one or more of the
          following types of misconduct:<br>
          <br>
          (1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see §
          1.6662-3);<br>
          <br>
          (2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see §
          1.6662-4); or<br>
          <br>
          (3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under
          chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement” or “gross
          valuation misstatement”), provided the applicable dollar
          limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see §
          1.6662-5).<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          (b) Amount of penalty -<br>
          <br>
          (1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is
          20 percent of the portion of an underpayment<br>
          of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable
          to any of the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs<br>
          (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in
          paragraph (b)(2) of this section.<br>
          <br>
          (2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.<br>
          In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in
          section 6662(h)(2) and § 1.6662-5(e)(2),<br>
          the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of
          the portion of an underpayment of tax required<br>
          to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross
          valuation misstatement, provided the applicable<br>
          dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is
          satisfied.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          § 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under
          chapter 1.<br>
          (a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined
          in section 6664(a) and<br>
          § 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of
          subtitle A of the Code that is<br>
          required to be shown on a return is attributable to a
          substantial valuation misstatement<br>
          under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement”), there
          is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such
          portion.<br>
          <br>
          Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the
          case of a gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1<br>
          (“gross valuation misstatement”).<br>
          No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a
          portion of an underpayment<br>
          that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation
          misstatement unless the aggregate<br>
          of all portions of the underpayment attributable to
          substantial or gross valuation misstatements<br>
          exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000),
          as provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs<br>
          (b) and<br>
          (f)(2) of this section.<br>
          This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the
          reasonable cause and good faith exception to this penalty<br>
          set forth in § 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure
          exception to this penalty.<br>
          <br>
          (b) Dollar limitation.<br>
          No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a
          taxable year unless<br>
          <br>
          the portion of the underpayment for that year that is
          attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements
          exceeds $5,000<br>
          ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S
          corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)(1));<br>
          <br>
          or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).<br>
          <br>
          This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for
          which there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          (e) Definitions -<br>
          <br>
          (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
          There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
          adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
          return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more
          of the correct amount.<br>
          <br>
          (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
          There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or
          adjusted basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
          imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
          amount.<br>
          <br>
          (3) Property.<br>
          For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to
          both tangible and intangible property.<br>
          Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
          fixtures and inventory.<br>
          Intangible property includes property such as goodwill,
          covenants not to compete, leaseholds, patents,<br>
          contract rights, debts and choses in action.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
          <br>
          (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
          substantial or gross.<br>
          The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
          valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
          made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example,
          that property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a
          value of 110,<br>
          and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims
          a value of 100.<br>
          <br>
          Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
          property-by-property basis,<br>
          there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
          property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
          even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more
          of the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate
          basis.<br>
          <br>
          (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying
          the dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
          the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
          attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
          is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
          attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>
          <br>
          Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on
          a return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the
          value claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of
          the correct value.<br>
          Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable
          to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return
          are aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
          limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment
          that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of
          property C, when aggregated with the portion of the
          underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the
          value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of
          most corporations).<br>
          <br>
          (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.<br>
          <br>
          The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any
          property with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is
          considered to be 400 percent or more of the correct amount.
          There is a gross valuation misstatement with respect to such
          property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 40
          percent.<br>

          (e) Definitions -<br>
          <br>
          (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
          There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
          adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
          return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more
          of the correct amount.<br>
          <br>
          (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
          There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or
          adjusted basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
          imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
          amount.<br>
          <br>
          (3) Property.<br>
          For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to
          both tangible and intangible property.<br>
          Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
          fixtures and inventory.<br>
          Intangible property includes property such as goodwill,
          covenants not to compete, leaseholds, patents,<br>
          contract rights, debts and choses in action.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
          <br>
          (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
          substantial or gross.<br>
          The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
          valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
          made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example,
          that property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a
          value of 110,<br>
          and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims
          a value of 100.<br>
          <br>
          Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
          property-by-property basis,<br>
          there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
          property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
          even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more
          of the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate
          basis.<br>
          <br>
          (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying
          the dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
          the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
          attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
          is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
          attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>
          <br>
          Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on
          a return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the
          value claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of
          the correct value.<br>
          Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable
          to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return
          are aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
          limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment
          that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of
          property C, when aggregated with the portion of the
          underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the
          value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of
          most corporations).<br>
          <br>
          (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.<br>
          <br>
          The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any
          property with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is
          considered to be 400 percent or more of the correct amount.
          There is a gross valuation misstatement with respect to such
          property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 40
          percent.<br>

          Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to
          sanction any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was
          associated with an investment adviser, if the Commission finds
          that the sanction is in the public interest and the person has

          15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements<br>
          (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of
          good faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.<br>
          Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in
          any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this
          chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any
          undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided
          in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which
          statement was at the time and in the light of the
          circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with
          respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person
          (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who,
          in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold
          a security at a price which was affected by such statement,
          for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued
          shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
          that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking
          to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any
          court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court
          may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment
          of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs,
          including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party
          litigant.<br>
          <br>
          (b)Contribution<br>
          Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this
          section may recover contribution as in cases of contract from
          any person who, if joined in the original suit, would have
          been liable to make the same payment.<br>
          <br>
          (c)Period of limitations<br>
          No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created
          under this section unless brought within one year after the
          discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and
          within three years after such cause of action accrued.<br>

          15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and
          oversight of self-regulatory organizations<br>
          (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of
          the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed
          rule filed by a registered securities association that
          primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in
          government securities, except where the Commission determines
          that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary
          action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of
          the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a
          proposed rule that has been published for comment, the
          Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
          before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
          Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such
          rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely
          affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for
          government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on
          competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
          purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to
          adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary
          and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section
          notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.<br>

          [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and
          markets depends on the<br>
          integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
          transparent disclosure.<br>
          Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
          fraudulent conduct is<br>
          antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have
          long held that a history of<br>
          egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
          participation in the<br>
          securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
          related to the<br>
          professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when
          he or she engaged<br>
          in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry
          relies on the fairness<br>
          and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
          professions covered by the<br>
          collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse

          -UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS<br>
          SEC. 17. (a)<br>
          It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter
          of or principal underwriter for a registered investment
          company (other than a company of the character described in
          section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of
          such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter, acting as
          principal-<br>
          (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such
          registered company or to any company controlled by such regis-
          tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities
          of which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the
          seller is the issuer and which are part of a general offering
          to the holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities
          deposited with the trustee of a unit investment trust or
          periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;<br>
          <br>
          (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or
          from any company controlled by such registered company, any
          security or other property (except securities of which the
          seller is the issuer)<br>

          <br>
          Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.<br>
          SEC. 17.<br>
          (h)     After one year from the effective date of this title,
          neither<br>
          the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
          association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any
          registered investment company, nor any other instrument
          pursuant to which such a company is organized or administered,
          shall contain any provision which protects or purports to
          protect any director or officer of such company against any
          liability to the company or to its security holders to which
          he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
          misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard
          of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.<br>
          <br>
                   In the event that any such instrument does not at the
          effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of
          this subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith
          prior to the expiration of said one year, such company may
          nevertheless continue to be a registered investment company
          and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to
          said expiration date each such director or officer shall have
          filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any
          protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it
          does not comply with this subsection, and each such person
          subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming office
          file a similar waiver.<br>
          <br>
          (i)     After one year from the effective date of this title
          no contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to
          act as investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a
          registered investment company shall contain any provision
          which protects or purports to protect such person against any
          liability to such company or its security holders to which he
          would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,
          bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his
          duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his
          obligations and duties under such contract or agreement.<br>
          <br>
          Injunctions against gross abuse.<br>
          SEC. 36.<br>
          The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
          district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
          any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of
          the United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in
          one or more of the following capacities has been guilty, after
          the enactment of this title and within five years of the
          commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse
          of trust in respect of any registered investment company for
          which such person so serves or acts:<br>
          (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board,
          investment adviser, or depositor; or<br>
          (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
          open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>
          certificate company.<br>
          If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or
          gross abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin
          such person from acting in such capacity or capacities either
          permanently or for such period of time as it in its discretion
          shall deem appropriate.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          SEC. 32.<br>
          (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
          order in the public interest or for the protection of
          investors, to require accountants and auditors to keep
          reports, work sheets, and other documents and papers relating
          to registered investment companies for such period or periods
          as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the same
          available for inspection by the Commission or any member or
          representative thereof.<br>

          DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS<br>
          SEC. 34.<br>
          <br>
          (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted
          by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to<br>
          destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other
          document the preservation of which has been required pursuant
          to section 31 (a) or 32 (c).<br>
          (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue
          statement of a material fact in any registration statement,
          application, report, account, record, or other document filed
          or transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which
          is required pursuant to section 31 (a).<br>
          <br>
          It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting,
          or keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact
          necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in
          the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
          from being materially misleading. For the purposes of this
          subsection, any part of any such document which is signed or
          certified by an accountant or auditor in his capacity as such
          shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by
          such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing,
          transmitting, or keeping the complete document.<br>
